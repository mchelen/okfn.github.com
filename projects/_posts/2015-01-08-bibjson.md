BibJSON is a convention for representing bibliographic metadata in
[JSON](http://www.json.org/).  It is intended as a specification for
developers of web applications that generate or accept bibliographic
metadata.  It is currently used in the Open Knowledge Labs
[BibServer](/projects/bibserver/) project.
