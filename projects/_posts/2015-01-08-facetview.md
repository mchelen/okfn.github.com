---

FacetView is a pure JavaScript frontend for
[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) search indices.  It
lets you easily embed a faceted browser and search frontend into any
web page. It also provides a micro-framework you can build on when
creating user interfaces to
[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/).  It is currently used
in the Open Knowledge Labs [BibServer](/projects/bibserver/) project.
